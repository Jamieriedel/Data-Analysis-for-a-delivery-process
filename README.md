# Data-Analysis-for-a-delivery-process

In this project we've been asked to analyze four given datasets of a company. 

First we were illustrating the companies delivery process and added the information we've been given and the datapoints.

After that was done we cleaned our data and where it was neccessary we joined the tables on the order_id. 

With the cleaned data we did some aggregations and visualized our outcome in some plots.

At the end we presented the slides in a technical presentation to our class.
